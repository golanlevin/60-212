## From the Questionnaire

### What concerns, if any, do you have about this course?

* I’m a little anxious about the technical side since I don’t have much coding background yet, and I worry about keeping up with the programming part. But I’m excited to learn and connect it to what I already enjoy doing:)
* I'm a little nervous about the coding aspect of this course, as I've always struggled with computer science. Last semester, I took a CS course in attempt to face down this CS arch nemesis of mine, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it's still quite challenging for me.. and I've never really gotten the hang of recursion.
* I'm worried about coding for sure because my only coding experience was AP CSP I took in my sophomore year in highschool.
* I haven't coded much after my CS course except a small ascii art webcam project I did over the summer so I need a bit of a refresher but I am excited for the projects.
* I am concerned that I will fall behind especially because I am new to p5.js...
* I'm anxious about not doing exceptionally compared with other students
* I think I'm putting some pressure on myself to execute something polished and innovative, partly because I've had so much casual experience with p5.js-tinkering, so my gut feeling is to say "Oh, by now I should be pretty proficient at working with it". Have to remember to try and to fail just as much as I would in any other creative class.
* I'm worried about the visual quality of my work... I'm weak in 2d design, especially color and composition. I would love any help and feedback throughout this course!
* I'm mostly worried about workload! I'm overloading this semester as I have 3 art + 3 STEM classes, but I'll do my best!

### What questions, if any, do you have about this course?

* I’d like to know whether we’ll get to combine our personal art styles (like drawing or animation) with the coding projects, and also how flexible the assignments will be for bringing in outside inspirations.
* I'd love to keep the assignment about color you mentioned! 
* I'm curious about the intersection between research and art, do you think this class could help with that?
* I don’t have specific questions yet — I’m just curious to see how creative coding can intersect with visual art and where it might take my work.
* I'd like to know how to make visuals with a systematic coding mindset
