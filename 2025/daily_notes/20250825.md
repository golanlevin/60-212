## Introductions

*Who's in this room?*

* About the Professor, [Golan Levin](https://art.cmu.edu/people/golan-levin/): Here are a few things I've done — art with [Generativity](https://www.artblocks.io/collection/cytographia-by-golan-levin) • [Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/golanlevin/AmbigrammaticFigures) • [Lasers](http://flong.com/archive/projects/gpp-ii/index.html) • [Robots](http://flong.com/archive/projects/snout/index.html) • [Weird performance](http://flong.com/archive/projects/messa/index.html) • [Creative Coding pedagogy](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262542043/code-as-creative-medium/)
* About our Teaching Assistant, [Lorie Chen](https://www.loriechen.com/) (BCSA '26)
* Please introduce yourselves!

## Logistics

*How does this class work?*

* [**Syllabus Review**](../syllabus/60-212_syllabus_fall2025.md)
* [No Tourists](../../2024/daily_notes/images/0826/no-tourists.jpg) 
* [Art will save us](../../2024/daily_notes/images/0826/maeda_nyt.jpg)
* This course is *doubly-intermediate*.
* Some students have reported that this is the hardest class you will take at CMU.
* [You're growing up](../../2024/daily_notes/images/0826/baby-bird-worm.gif). Inevitably, in this course, you'll have to figure some things out yourself.
* Playing a sport or musical instrument requires *practice*. This course is a type of athletic training. 
* Thankfully, units do not build on each other. If you miss a unit, just move on.
* [Make (lots of) shoddy work](images/fast-cheap-good.jpg).

In *Art & Fear*, authors David Bayles and Ted Orland tell a vivid parable:
>  A ceramics teacher split their class in two on the first day. One group would be graded on quantity—they must produce many pots (e.g. fifty pounds scores an *A*, etc.). The other group was graded on quality—just one near-perfect pot is sufficient for an *A*. At semester’s end, the highest-quality work came from the quantity group. While those students learned through trial and error, the quality-focused group overthought and produced little usable work.

## Let's Get To Work

*How do I get started?*

* Look at the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) or [the older version](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/)
* Look at our [OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/100952#/). *(Peek at classrooms from [2024](https://openprocessing.org/class/93074#/) and [2023](https://openprocessing.org/class/86356#/)!)*
* Let's [make a new sketch at OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/create), and submit it.
* [**Walkthrough of Assignment #1**](../assignments/assignment_1.md), due this Wednesday
* Don't forget the [**Welcome Form & Exit Ticket**](https://forms.gle/L4FDuXApCnWMobiX7)!

### Regarding AI

This course will intersect with AI in a lot of different ways: for example, as a subject for creative exploration, but also as a tool to help you realize your work. 

The best creative coders I know use AI routinely, as do I. That said, if I'm giving you a problem that could be solved entirely by AI, then one of the following things must be the case:

* I'll be crystal clear about the fact that I want you to do it yourself, *regardless*, OR
* I'm expecting you to use AI, *dammit*; why are you wasting your time, OR
* I didn't give you an interesting problem; it's my fault, OR
* You haven't found a way to make it *your own* —or you didn't even think to try
