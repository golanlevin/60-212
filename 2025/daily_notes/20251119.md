### Next: TouchDesigner Warmup

*Due Monday November 24; 2-3 hours.* We are still learning the basics. For next monday 11/24, **do** the following:

* **Watch**: [Shapes and Colors](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/topic/shapes-colors/) (5 minutes)
* **Watch**: [Basic Compositing](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/topic/basic-compositing/) (5 minutes)
* Feel free to **watch** any of the other sections of the [100-series Working with Images lectures](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/102-tops-working-with-images/).

#### *Then*: **Do** [Feedback and Instancing tutorials for assignment 8.4](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2025/assignments/assignment_8b.md#84--instancing-and-feedback-tutorials). 

<!--
 
Then: **follow along** and **execute** these two TouchDesigner tutorial projects, shown below:

* **Do**: [Organic Color Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHPrDMqOmJ0) ("Feedback"; 30-60 minutes)
* **Do**: [Instancing Geometry with Mouse Interactivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJZIMGg-thY) (60-90 minutes)

*Now,* in a Discord post in the `#8-4-warmup` channel, please do the following:

* **Embed** a brief moving image (screen-captured video, animated GIF, or unlisted YouTube link) for each of the two project tutorials. It doesn’t have to be a fancy or lengthy video; I just need to see receipts. (However, if you'd like to know how to export a noce clean video, follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G01ZRJpkDCA).)
* **Write** a sentence or two about your experience. What do you appreciate about TouchDesigner? What concerns or confusions do you have? Did you tinker with the project, and if so, how?
