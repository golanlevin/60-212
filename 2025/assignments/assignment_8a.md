## Touchdesigner: Responsive/Interactive Environment

In this assignment, we will create an open-ended interactive assignment that will emphasize on visualising and mastering a real-world input. 

This assignment is due in several parts. The first portion will be to watch and follow along with some introductory technical content to catch-up the uninitiated; and to do a small looking outwards. Due at the start of class **Wednesday November 20**: 

* 8.1 : [Getting Ready](#81-getting-ready-no-deliverable) *(30 minutes, due Monday, 11/17)*
* 8.2 : [Introductory video completion](#82-viewing-introductory-videos) *(10%, 60-90 minutes, due Wednesday 11/19)*
* 8.3 : [Looking Outwards: Interaction and Touch](#83-looking-outwards-interaction-and-touch) *(10%, 30 minutes, due Wednesday 11/19)*

## 8.1 Getting Ready (No Deliverable)

*(5%, 30 minutes, due Monday, 11/17)* Touchdesigner is a desktop/laptop rendering and programming environment. Unlike p5.js, we will require everyone to have it installed and ready to use on your computer. 

By the next session of class, we need the following **4** things from you:

* **A 3-Button Mouse** for you to use during class (it is *possible* to use Touchdesigner without a 3-button mouse, but is significantly harder and will slow you down significantly).
* **Your Computer Charger**: Touchdesigner uses the full power of your CPU and GPU whenever possible. Every time you use Touchdesigner, you will want your laptop to be plugged in.
* **Touchdesigner Official Release** software installed, and a Non-Commercial (Educational) License Activated. You can find the download files [here](https://derivative.ca/download) 
* **Make sure TouchDesigner opens properly** and runs on your laptop. If it doesn't, you'll have to use a school computer. 
* Also, please **add** your *Body/Creature* project to [this OpenProcessing classroom slot](https://openprocessing.org/class/100952/#/c/102844) — thank you!

* **Screenshot and submit** the progress you have made. In the Discord channel `#8-2-tutorials-1xx`, include some screenshots of your tutorial work. 


*Note: In this class, students may already have a variety of levels of experience with this toolkit.

![tdmirror.jpg](../../2024/assignments/images/emtouchdesignerlectures/10.2.png)

*(10%, 30 minutes, due Wednesday 11/19)* 

* **Spend 20-30 minutes online** looking for content made in Touchdesigner that features some *interaction* that interests you. Search under takgs like **#touchdesigner /#doitintops**. Recommended sites to do this viewing are Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and Vimeo. The [official TouchDesigner showcase on Vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/groups/touchdesigner/sort:plays/format:thumbnail) is particularly good.
* **Write** one sentence about why this form of interaction or visualization interests you.
* **Screenshot and submit the link** to the piece. In the Discord channel `#8-3-looking-outwards`
