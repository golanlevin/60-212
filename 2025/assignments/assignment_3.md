*Our third set of Deliverables is due at the beginning of class on Wednesday, September 10. The primary topics it emphasizes are animation, timing, and geometry. I estimate that it will take you about 6-7 hours. In addition to 4 creative coding projects, it also requires 2 brief Discord posts.*

***NOTE: I will have office hours next Tuesday evening (9/9/24) in CFA-303 from 5-11pm.*** *Lorie and I are also generally available on Discord for questions!*

## Readings & Looking Outwards

1. **Looking Outwards.** Spend 10-20 minutes checking out the work of professional loopmakers like: 
	* [Bees and Bombs](https://www.instagram.com/davebeesbombs/) [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/davebeesbombs/) / [tumblr](https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/)
	* [Melissa Rodriguez](https://objkt.com/profile/tz1UtTasn4DTyb9rHYnLAjxSQHfkvAWtBbAQ/created)
	* [Etienne Jacob](https://bleuje.com/animationsite/)
	* [Cindy Suen](https://cargocollective.com/cindysuen)
	* [Lucas Zanotto](https://www.instagram.com/lucas_zanotto/?hl=en)

	In the Discord channel `#3-Looking-Outwards`, **embed** or **post** a link to a loop that you appreciated, and **write** a sentence or two about what you liked.
2. **Reading**. Skim or read the article “[On Repeat: How to Use Loops to Explain Anything](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/on-repeat-how-to-use-loops-to-explain-anything)” by Lena Groeger, an information designer at ProPublica. This article is purely for your edification/entertainment; there’s no deliverable for this reading. It should take about 10-15 minutes to browse this elegant stack of inspirations.
