# Assignment Set #2

### Due Wednesday, September 3, 2025


---

*Our second set of Deliverables is due at the beginning of class on Wednesday, September 3. The primary topics it emphasizes are: iteration and nested iteration; controlled randomness, and graphics transformations. I estimate that it will take you about 4-6 hours.*

*We are still in a phase of the course that emphasizes the development of basic programming skills, knowledge of your toolset, careful observation, and precision execution. This is not a particularly “open-ended” set of Deliverables (though the "Moiré" projects have a good deal of room for creative expression). Things will open out more, soon.*

***NOTE: On Labor Day (Monday 9/1) I will be available to help you during office hours, from 2-10pm in CFA-303.***
