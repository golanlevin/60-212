## 1.1. Administrative Tasks

(***30 minutes***) Please **complete** the following administrative tasks:

* (*1 minute*) **Bookmark** our [Course GitHub](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2025/readme.md) in your laptop's browser.
* (*4 minutes*) **Create** an ID on [Discord.com](https://discord.com/), if you don't already have one. **Join** our class Discord, using the invitation sent to you by email. **Browse** our server's channels so you know what goes where.
* (*10 minutes*) **Create** an ID on [OpenProcessing.org](https://openprocessing.org) (if you don't already have one). **Join** our [OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/100952#/), using the invitation sent to you by email, and **bookmark** it in your laptop's browser. **Browse** some of the sketches that people have published at [https://openprocessing.org/discover](https://openprocessing.org/discover). *(Note: the quality varies widely!)* Run the programs, and be sure to **look** at their code (*command-shift-return* may help switch to the code view). In the `#main-chatter` channel of the course Discord, **paste** a link to one or two projects that you found interesting. (No writing is necessary.)
* (*15 minutes*) **Review** the [Syllabus](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2025/syllabus/60-212_syllabus_fall2025.md) carefully, and **complete** the [**Welcome Form & Exit Ticket**](https://forms.gle/L4FDuXApCnWMobiX7).

## 1.2. Looking Outwards Post

(***20 minutes***) Please **write** a "[Looking Outwards](https://github.com/golanlevin/lectures/blob/master/syllabi/looking-outwards.md)" post, as follows: 

* **Recall** a project you have admired (prior to this course) which you feel falls under the broad umbrella of "Creative Coding". 
* **Create** a post in the `#looking-outwards-1` channel in the course Discord. In a few sentences, **describe** the project, and **explain** what you like about the. It's sufficient to write 3-5 sentences. 
* **Include** a link (URL) to the project or its documentation (such as a YouTube video).
* **Embed** an image of the project in your post.

## 1.3. Wayfinding 

(***30 minutes***] Wayfinding: **ensure** you know where to get help

* (*10 minutes*) **Browse** the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/). Examine at least ten Reference pages, starting with the [Shape commands](https://p5js.org/reference/#Shape). Note that many of the Reference pages allow you to tinker with the code. *(For what it's worth, I happen to prefer the [old version of the reference](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/).)*
* (*10 minutes*) **Browse** the [p5.js Examples](https://archive.p5js.org/examples/) archive, which are organized thematically. Review at least ten p5.js Examples, skimming their code.
* (*10 minutes*) **Browse** some of the many free YouTube tutorials for p5.js, including those by: [Dan Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain/playlists) (Coding Train), [Xin Xin](https://www.youtube.com/@xinxin1011/videos) and CMU alum, [Patt Vira](https://www.youtube.com/@pattvira/playlists). Their offerings range from [completely introductory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) to impressively advanced.

Additionally: 

* Unless otherwise indicated, feel welcome to use AI systems while programming, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or CoPilot. *(In your project reports, be sure to indicate that you received assistance from these systems.)*
* If you find it helpful, Lauren McCarthy's book, "[Getting Started with p5.js](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781457186769/?sso_link=yes&sso_link_from=cmu-edu)" is available online for free through the CMU libraries.
* Remember, if you get stuck while making the projects, you can always give a shout in the `#haaaalp` channel in the course Discord.
* See the [helpful tools](#helpful-tools) documented at the bottom of this page.

## 1.4. Four Small Exercises

(***60 minutes***) **Complete** the following four mini-assignments in our [OpenProcessing classroom](https://openprocessing.org/class/100952#/). These are not particularly 'creative' projects; the purpose of these exercises is to help me assess your preparedness and baseline level of programming skill.

* **1.4.1.** (*5 minutes*) **Do** [Iteration: Transitioning Rectangles](https://openprocessing.org/class/93074/#/c/93123)
* **1.4.2.** (*10 minutes*) **Do** [Nested Iteration & Randomness: Grid, Interrupted]()
* **1.4.3.** (*15 minutes*) **Do** [Transformations + Functional Abstraction: Critter Stamps]()
* **1.4.4.** (*30 minutes*) **Do** [Array of (Animating) Objects: Ripples]()

For each of these exercises, submit it to the appropriate slot in the OpenProcessing classroom. For these exercises, no other documentation (writeup, screenshot, etc.) is required.

## Helpful Tools

### Locating Pixel Coordinates

It can sometimes be challenging to locate the pixel coordinates you want. You may find it helpful to plan your design using [graph paper](https://print-graph-paper.com/), or by displaying your cursor's coordinates using something like the following (find the code [here](https://editor.p5js.org/golan/sketches/vvEg7XbQ4)):

### Choosing Colors

In can also be challenging to get the values that describe the color you want. You may find it helpful to refer to this [table of common Web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Extended_colors) (which can help you refer to colors by name) as well as the [Digital Color Meter app](https://medium.com/mac-os-x/digital-color-meter-in-mac-machine-e961bedca040) that comes with MacOS. Additionally, you can easily access a color picker by [searching for one on Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker):
