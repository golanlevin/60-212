## Logistics

*How does this class work?*

* [**Syllabus Review**](https://github.com/golanlevin/60-212/blob/main/2024/syllabus/60-212_syllabus_fall2024.md)
* [No Tourists](images/0826/no-tourists.jpg) 
* [Art will save us](images/0826/maeda_nyt.jpg)
* [You're growing up](images/0826/baby-bird-worm.gif). You'll have to figure many things out yourself. This will be the hardest class you take at CMU.
* [Make (lots of) shoddy work](images/0826/fast-cheap-good.jpg). The Quality/Quantity Experiment. Racehorses. Thankfully, units do not build on each other. If you miss a unit, just move on.
* Bricked.
