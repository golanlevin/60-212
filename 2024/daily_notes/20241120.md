## Touchdesigner Refresher and Class Assets
* Unlike p5 I cannot simply share a sketch online with you all, you must have you download my .tox or .toe files and boot them up in order to see. Because of this I have our [TD Demo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10GZBHYytJOIZNoSTE4rzYP59RFDA83OU?usp=sharing) linked from my personal drive. 
* Sometimes I use different builds of Touchdesigner in parallel, so if there is an error saying that there is "version difference", ignore it, everything should work exactly the same

* What we will talk about today BASELINE
