## Touchdesigner: Interactive Environment

In this assignment, we will have a more open ended interactive assignment that will emphasize on visualising and mastering a real-world input. 


* 10.4: Intermediate Instancing and Feedback Tutorials *(10% 2 hours, Due 11/25)*
* 10.5: Interactive Environment *(70%, >5 hours, Due 12/10)*

## 10.4 : Instancing and Feedback Tutorials
*(10%, 2 hours, due 11/25)* 
Feedback and instancing are two effects that are common workflows I would like you all to have a mastery of. They are not difficult, but expand your arsenal. Your final project does not need to include them, but they may be useful for you to have available

* There are going to be **5** videos linked below. A mild and a spicy video for each topic. I am only asking you to watch and follow along with **2** tutorials.

* [Instancing Mild 🌶️ Instancing Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFG-FBKuJow)

* [Extra Spicy 🌶️🌶️🌶️ Feedback Influenced Instancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv2nTk4lr-E) (noones goes very fast, take your time, pause and slow down the video if necessary)

* Once you complete the tutorials, change SOMETHING SMALL about them. It could be something as miniscule as the period of the noise, or the shape of your instancing objects, or the color scheme. Do some simple transformation on top of the base tutorial to show that you know how certain characteristics of the patch work. Post a screenshot of the patches working, and the output in the discord channel `#10-intermediate-tutorials`

## 10.5 Progress Report (1.5 hours max) Due 12/4
* In the #10-progress-report channel in discord post a screenshot of what you have so far for the Interactive Environment project. 
* Write a couple sentences on what you intend to do or what tools you intend to use
* What you can write about or show 
    * a sketch of what you want the final to look like or do
    * a preliminary node network or rudimentary output
    * a tool or node that is the "main" function of your patch
    * an example that inspires you that you intend to recreate or borrow functionality from

* What you cannot do for this project
    * Use the output directly from a tutorial without accrediting the source

## 10.5 Interactive Environment

*(70%, >5 hours due 12/10)* 


* Create a Touchdesigner patch that creates a graphic corresponding to some sort of **INPUT**. This could be a camera, computer vision, OSC, MIDI, serial devices like Arduino (with LittleBits), Google MediaPipe bodytracking, audio, live screen grabs, realtime web pages, keyboard input, etc.

This project will have multiple phases over the rest of the semester: 

* 12/02 will be a work day where everyone will have a ~10 minute meeting with Em to establish a project direction/prescribe useful tools/look at previous and similar work. After you meet with Em you are welcome to stay and work or work where you please. 
* 12/04 will be a small showing of WIPs, or sketches of what you intend to do. This is non-binding. What you show in the WIP does not limit what you can do for the final submission.
* 12/10: final presentations and celebration of your work.

### Project 10 Final Deliverables


* **Video Documentation**. Create a brief video to document your project. This likely means you will **export an .mp4 file and create an unlisted YouTube video**. Instructions on how to export .mp4 videos from TouchDesigner are [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSpaWDQP5O4). Depending on your project, it may also be helpful for you to record and intercut "over-the-shoulder" (camera) video of you using your interactive software, interface hardware, etc. If you do appear in your documentation, give consideration to lighting, your choice of environment, your 'costume', and rehearsing your 'performance'. 
* **Create a post** in the `#10-interactive-environment` Discord channel.
* In the post, **write 1-2 paragraphs** (150-200 words) about your project: what it *is*, what your *goals* were, the *challenges* you overcame in developing it, and your *evaluation* of the results. Be sure to **acknowledge** any inspirations or sources of assistance.
* In the post, **link** to your YouTube video documentation. **Make sure** the video is set to unlisted/public (and not "private").
* In the post, **include 1-3 images** of your project. These might be screengrabs, photographs, sketches, diagrams, etc.
* **Final Presentation**. In our special evening session on Tuesday December 10th, **give a 3-5 minute presentation** about your project. (The class will provide feedback in a collective Google doc.)
