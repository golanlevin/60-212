# Assignment Set #10a

## Touchdesigner: Interactive Environment

In this assignment, we will have a more open ended interactive assignment that will emphasize on visualising and mastering a real-world input. 

This assignment is due in several parts. The first portion will be to watch and follow along with some introductory technical content to catch-up the uninitiated; and to do a small looking outwards. Due at the start of class **Wednesday November 20**: 

* 10.1 : Getting Ready *(20 minutes)*
* 10.2 :[Introductory video Completion](#91-Introductory-videos) *(10%, 60-80 minutes)*
* 10.3 :[Looking Outwards: Interaction and Touch](#72-looking-outwards-generative-art) *(10%, 20 minutes)*

## 10.1 Getting Ready (No Deliverable)
*(5%, 20 minutes, due 11/20)* Touchdesigner is a DESKTOP rendering and programming environment, unlike p5 we will require everyone have it installed and ready to use in peak-performance

* By next class I need **4** things from you
* **A 3 Button Mouse** for you to use during class (it is POSSIBLE to use Touchdesigner without a 3-button mouse, but is significantly harder and will slow you down majorly)
* **Your Computer Charger**: Touchdesigner uses the full power of your CPU adn GPU whenever possible, especially if you intend to go above 60 fps. Every time you use Touchdesigner you will want your laptop to be plugged in
* Touchdesigner Official Release installed, and a Non-Commerical License Activated 
    * You can find the download files [here](https://derivative.ca/download) 
* Make sure TouchDesigner opens properly and runs
